# PixelAngelo

PixelAngelo is a web application that uses the RealESRGAN_x2plus.pth model to upscale images by 2x. Simply select an image file or drag and drop an image over the drop zone, and wait for the model to upscale the image. Once complete, compare and contrast the difference in quality using the slider. Download any upscaled images.
